## "Reality is whatever I want it to be." - Tony Stark

MARK VII (Multi-Adaptive Reconstitution Kit for Visual & Intonation Intelligence) is a cutting-edge deepfake generation system that pushes the boundaries of synthetic media creation. Based on groundbreaking neural network architectures, MARK VII can synthesize highly realistic video and audio from minimal input data.

## üöÄ Features

- **Full Facial Reconstitution**: Precisely maps and manipulates facial features from source video
- **Neural Voice Synthesis**: Generates natural-sounding speech in the subject's voice 
- **Multi-Language Support**: Create deepfakes in 9 different languages
- **Seamless Lip Sync**: Advanced synchronization between generated speech and facial movements
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple Tkinter GUI for all skill levels
- **Multi-Player Support**: Integrated playback with popular media players

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

This software is provided for **research, educational, and creative purposes only**. We emphasize responsible use. Impersonating individuals without consent or creating misleading content may violate privacy laws, identity theft laws, and other legal protections in many jurisdictions. 

**By downloading and using MARK VII, you agree to:**
- Not use this technology to create content that could harm, defame, or misrepresent others
- Clearly label all synthetic media as AI-generated when publishing
- Obtain appropriate permissions when creating synthetic representations of real people
- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Omdeepb69/Facial-Reconstitution-and-Neural-Synthesis.git
cd Facial-Reconstitution-and-Neural-Synthesis

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download pretrained models
python download_models.py
```

## üîß Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
python mark_vii.py
```

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Launch the application
2. Load a source video containing the target subject
3. Select an output location for the generated video
4. Enter the text you want the subject to say
5. Choose the desired language
6. Click "Start Process" and wait for generation to complete
7. Use the built-in media player buttons to view your creation


## üß™ Technical Architecture

MARK VII utilizes a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Identity Extraction**: Analyzes source video to create a digital identity map
2. **Speech Analysis**: Extracts voice characteristics from the source video
3. **Text Transformation**: Converts input text to phoneme sequences
4. **Voice Synthesis**: Generates natural speech with the subject's voice characteristics
5. **Facial Animation**: Creates precise facial movements synchronized with speech
6. **Final Render**: Composites everything into the final video output
